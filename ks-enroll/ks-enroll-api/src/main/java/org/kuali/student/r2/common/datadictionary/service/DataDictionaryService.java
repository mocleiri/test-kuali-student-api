/**
 * Data Dictionary Service
 *
 * Provides a read-only view of meta data about the objects and fields
 * on those objects that are known to the service for which the data
 * dictionary is included.
 *
 * The dictionary service is aligned with Rice's KRAD dictionary, as
 * such the dictionary structures should match up field for field.
 *
 * The Data Dictionary Service is an "included" service in that it is
 * not expected to be a web service on it's own but instead it's
 * methods simply appear (are "included") on the service that includes
 * it.
