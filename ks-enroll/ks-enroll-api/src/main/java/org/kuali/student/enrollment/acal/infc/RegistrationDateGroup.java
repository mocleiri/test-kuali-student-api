/**
 * A cluster of hardened dates pertinent to an academic term.
 *
 * A Date Group is a short cut to accessing a set of KeyDates dates
 * relating to a Term. An RegistrationDateGroup is available for all
 * Terms by default and does not explicitly need to be created.
 *
 * The dates in this group map to KeyDates. If a KeyDate does not
 * exist, then the return value is null. An update of this structure
 * will update the corresponding KeyDate if it exists, or create one
 * of the appropriate Type if it does not exist.
 *
 * The KeyDate Type is used to link a specific KeyDate with one of the
 * elements in this structure. For example, getRegistrationStartDate()
 * returns the starting date of the range in a KeyDate of type
 * kuali.apt.milestone.RegistrationPeriod for the associated term.
