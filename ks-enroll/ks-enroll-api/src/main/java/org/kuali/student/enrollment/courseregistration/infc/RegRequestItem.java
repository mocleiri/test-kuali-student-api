/**
 * Represents a single reg group in the request to register. This request is
 * also used to request waitlist or drop a course. It has transaction type of
 * either ADD, DROP, SWAP or UPDATE to represent adding (waitlisting,
 * holdlisting), dropping courses or persisting an item from the reg cart with
 * changes to it. It has other options like grading and credit options that a
 * student can specify while registering. There will be options like
 * okToWaitlist, okToHoldList, okToExceptionList which will help specify if the
 * student wants to go to a waitlist/holdlist in case there's no seat
 * availability for the course. A request to waitlist a course should always
 * have okToWaitlist set to true, same for hold or exception lists.
 * <P>

 * course - {@link RegRequestItem} Type is ADD , newRegGroupId is the reg group
 * to be registered for 2. Register for course but waitlist if seat not

 * and existing reg group ids populated. new is to be the one replaced with the
