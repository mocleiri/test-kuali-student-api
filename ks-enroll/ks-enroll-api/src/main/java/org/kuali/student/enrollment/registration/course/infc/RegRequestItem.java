 * Represents a single reg group in the request to register. This request is
 * also used to request waitlist or drop a course. It has transaction type of
 * either ADD, DROP, or UPDATE to represent adding (waitlisting, holdlisting),
 * dropping courses or persisting an item from the reg cart with changes to it.
 * It has other options like grading and credit options that a student can
 * specify while registering. There will be options like okToWaitlist,
 * okToHoldList, okToExceptionList which will help specify if the student wants
 * to go to a waitlist/holdlist in case there's no seat availability for the
 * course. A request to waitlist a course should always have okToWaitlist set to
 * true, same for hold or exception lists.
