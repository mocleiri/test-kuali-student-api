/**
 * Represents the selected rows within the model.
 * 
 * <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Models used with the DynamicTable widget can be larger than the browser can easily handle.  In current uses they
 * frequently exceed 100,000 records. (In testing, models of over 100,000,000 records have been used.)
 * 
 * Because of the potential for large models, and the table's ability to "select all", the Selection object cannot always contain all of the record identifiers.
 * 
 * The solution to this is to use a flag (SelectionType) that indicates whether the section mode is inclusive or exclusive of the identifiers in the list.
 * This relies on the fact that it is unlikely for a user to manually select more record identifiers than can be easily transmitted via RPC.
