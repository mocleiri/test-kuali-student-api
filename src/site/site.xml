<!-- 
As soon as Maven publishes 3.0-beta4 of the maven-site-plugin we can get rid of this file
We need a published version of that plugin that contains a fix for this bug http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MSITE-532 
The bug is already fixed, but they haven't re-published the plugin yet.  
As soon as that is ready, we can move <menu ref="modules" inherit="top"/> into the top level Kuali site descriptor and
stop adding custom site descriptors to every Kuali project
